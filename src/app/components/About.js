              I am a motivated and adaptable web developer with hands-on
              experience in building responsive and scalable web applications
              using the MERN stack. My journey started with a strong academic
              foundation in Computer Science and has evolved through real-world
              projects, freelance work, and internships. Iâ€™ve developed and
              contributed to multiple production-level applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              Proficient in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and
              modern front-end tools like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap and SASS, I
              bring both technical depth and a keen eye for UI/UX. Whether
              working in a team or independently, I thrive on solving
              challenges, writing clean code, and continuously learning new
              technologies to deliver high-impact solutions.
